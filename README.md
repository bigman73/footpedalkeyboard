# footpedalkeyboard
A foot pedal keyboard, using Korg EC5, Arduino and Python
Converts pedal button events into operating system virtual keyboard sequences.
For example: If Pedal A is clicked (pressed and released) then the python driver will generate a Media Prev keyboard stroke on the operating system. A musician can then control music playback by using his/her feet, a very natural way for musicians that use foot pedals for effects and volume control, when playing instruments such as guitar, bass guitar and keyboards.

## The final result
